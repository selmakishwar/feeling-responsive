    <a href="http://www.gap-system.org/">GAP</a> is a free, open and
    extensible system for discrete computational algebra, with
    particular emphasis on Computational Group Theory. GAP provides a
    programming language, a library of thousands of functions
    implementing algebraic algorithms written in the GAP language as
    well as large data libraries of algebraic objects.
