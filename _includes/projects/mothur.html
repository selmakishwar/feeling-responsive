    <a href="http://www.mothur.org">mothur</a> is an open source and
    portable software package that meets the bioinformatics needs of
    the microbial ecology research community. It is particularly
    useful for analyzing 16S rRNA gene sequences that have been
    generated using a variety of sequencing platforms. We emphasize
    making the software as easy to use as possible through our efforts
    in maintaining a wiki, blog, and user forum.
