title: Four More Screencasts on Testing
category: ["Content"]
---
<p>After far too many delays, the next four screencasts on testing are finally available, covering systematic unit testing with Nose, why you should test interfaces rather than implementations, why testing floating point is hard, and how to create and manage fixtures systematically. I hope you enjoy them&mdash;have a good weekend.</p>
