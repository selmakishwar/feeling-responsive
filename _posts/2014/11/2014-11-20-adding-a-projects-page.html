<p>
  It's long overdue,
  but we've finally started a page to showcase
  the <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/projects.html">projects that our instructors are involved in</a>.
  If you'd like to add one,
  please send us a pull request
  or <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">mail us</a> for instructions.

  (Turns out, we do pretty cool stuff...)
