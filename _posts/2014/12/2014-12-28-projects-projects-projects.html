  We have updated our <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/projects.html">projects page</a> with links to:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    things we're building ourselves, and
  </li>
  <li>
    things that our members are building.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The first list includes the templates for
  <a href="{{site.github_url}}/lesson-template">lessons</a>
  and <a href="{{site.github_url}}/workshop-template">workshop websites</a>,
  a <a href="{{site.github_url}}/amy">a tool for managing workshops</a>
  (for which we're using Django),
  the <a href="https://github.com/twitwi/deck.browsercast.js/">latest version</a> of
  <a href="http://third-bit.com/browsercast/">Browsercast</a>,
  and more.
  The second list has everything from
  <a href="http://www.activepapers.org/" class="project">active papers</a>
  to <a href="http://jrsmith3.github.io/tec/">utilities for simulating vacuum thermionic energy conversion devices</a>.
  If you'd like to help with the first,
  or if you're a <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2014/12/standing-for-election.html#members">member</a>
  and would like your project listed in the second,
  please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">get in touch</a>.

  And since this is likely to be my last post of 2014,
  I'd like to say "thank you" to everyone who helped Software Carpentry get from where it was to where it is.
  We taught more than 4000 people,
  and we're on track to reach even more in 2015.
  It's been a privilege to work with so many talented, dedicated people&mdash;best wishes for the new year.
