<p>
  As <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2014/12/projects-projects-projects.html">we said in December</a>,
  we're planning to use <a href="https://github.com/twitwi/deck.browsercast.js/">the latest incarnation of Browsercast</a>
  as <a href="http://third-bit.com/browsercast/">a web-native alternative to screencasting</a>
  for recording and presenting our slideshows.
  <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/team.html#huff.k">Katy Huff</a> has just recorded the first of these,
  which you can <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/slideshows/introducing-software-carpentry/index.html">watch on GitHub</a>.
  We'd be very grateful for feedback
  both on <a href="{{site.github_url}}/slideshows/issues">its content</a>
  and on <a href="https://github.com/twitwi/deck.browsercast.js/issues">Browsercast in general</a>.
