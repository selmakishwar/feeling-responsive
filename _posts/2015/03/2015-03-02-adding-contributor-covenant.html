<p>
  The Software Carpentry Foundation's Steering Committee has voted to add
  a <a href="{{site.github_url}}/lesson-template/blob/gh-pages/CONDUCT.md">Contributor Covenant</a>
  to our lessons and other repositories.
  Like the <a href="{{page.root}}/conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a> for our workshops,
  the <a href="{{site.github_url}}/lesson-template/blob/gh-pages/CONDUCT.md">Contributor Covenant</a>'s aim is
  to ensure that participation in Software Carpentry is a harassment-free experience for everyone,
  regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
  disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion.
